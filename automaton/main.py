# you_play() runs an automaton on words of your choosing.
# function_test() runs some assertions to make sure basic things are behaving well.
# do_homework() does the homework assignment that was assigned July 17.

# The documentation of automaton.py (the Automaton class) is decent.

# The documentation of regular.py (the functions that compute a regular expression
# for a given automaton) is an ambitious project - the comments ARE an induction proof
# that the regular expression can be found.

# Hit "run" in the top bar if you want to run whatever is set up to run here right now.

# do proper unit tests.
